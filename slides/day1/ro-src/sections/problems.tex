  The 3 fundamental problems \citep{rabiner1989tutorial}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Particularization of temporal inference problems to the HMM case
  	\item The restricted structure of the HMM allows for elegant implementations of all the basic algorithms
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Evaluation Problem}
    Given a model and a sequence of observations, how do we compute the probability that the \alert{observed 
    sequence} was produced by the model?
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Best Explanation of Observations Problem}
    Given a model and a sequence of observations how do we choose a corresponding sequence of \alert{states} which 
    \emph{gives meaning} to the observations? How do we \emph{uncover} the hidden part of the model?
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{block}{Model Estimation (Training) Problem}
    Given some observed sequences, how do we adjust the \alert{parameters} of an HMM model that best tries to explain 
    the observations?
